# ï»¿Gradio with Fine-Tuned LLaMA 2 Using QLoRA & Peft
This guide provides instructions to set up a text generation pipeline with Gradio using a fine-tuned LLaMA 2 model, leveraging QLoRA for parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT). The model is trained with the Guanaco dataset, and Gradio is used to create a simple web-based interface for testing and showcasing the model's capabilities.

# Requirements
Python 3.7+
CUDA-compatible GPU
Hugging Face Transformers library
Datasets library
PyTorch with CUDA support
bitsandbytes
LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)
Gradio
Ngrok
Docker (optional, for containerization)
Setup
To set up this project, ensure you have the necessary libraries installed. You can use a virtual environment to keep the dependencies organized:

# Create a virtual environment
$ python -m venv llm_venv

# Activate the virtual environment
source llm_venv/bin/activate  # Linux/macOS

 or
 
.\llm_venv\Scripts\activate  # Windows

# Install the required libraries
$ pip install -q accelerate==0.21.0 peft==0.4.0 bitsandbytes==0.40.2 transformers==4.31.0 trl==0.4.7 gradio pyngrok

# Fine-Tuning the LLaMA 2 Model
The provided code snippet fine-tunes the LLaMA 2 model using QLoRA. The dataset used for fine-tuning is mlabonne/guanaco-llama2-1k, which contains 1000 instruction-following samples.

# Key Parameters for Fine-Tuning
LoRA Parameters: Set the rank, alpha, and dropout for LoRA layers.
bitsandbytes Parameters: Enable 4-bit precision loading for memory efficiency.
TrainingArguments Parameters: Configure the training process, including the number of epochs, batch size, and learning rate.
Fine-Tuning Process
Load the dataset and tokenizer.
Configure the LoRA settings.
Create the SFTTrainer instance for supervised fine-tuning.
Train the model with the configured parameters.
Save the fine-tuned model to disk for later use.
Building the Gradio Interface
Gradio is used to create a simple web-based interface that allows users to interact with the fine-tuned model.

# Function to Generate Responses
A simple function, generate_response, is defined to take a user prompt and generate a response using the fine-tuned model. This function is used as the primary interface for Gradio.

# Gradio Interface
The Gradio interface is configured with a text input for user prompts and a text output for the generated responses. Additional parameters control the model's behavior, such as temperature, repetition_penalty, and top-k filtering.

# Running Gradio with Ngrok
To make the Gradio interface accessible on a public URL, Ngrok is used to create a secure tunnel to the local Gradio server. This allows others to access the interface over the internet.

# Docker Support
For a more portable and reproducible setup, consider using Docker. A Dockerfile can be used to create an environment to run the Gradio server. Here's a brief summary of how to build and run the Docker container:

# Build the Docker Image:
$ docker build -t gradio-llama2 .

# Run the Docker Container:
$ docker run --gpus all -p 7865:7865 gradio-llama2

# Access the Gradio Interface:
Once the container is running, you can access the Gradio interface at http://localhost:7865. If using Ngrok, update the Gradio server port and connect with Ngrok to get a public URL.
Running the Project
To run the project without Docker, execute the provided Python script. This script:

# Fine-tunes the LLaMA 2 model using the specified parameters.
Sets up the Gradio interface with the generate_response function.
Starts the Ngrok tunnel and launches the Gradio server.

# Conclusion
With this guide, you can create a text generation pipeline using a fine-tuned LLaMA 2 model, integrating QLoRA for efficient fine-tuning, and Gradio for a web-based interface. This setup is suitable for prototyping AI-powered applications that require text generation capabilities.
